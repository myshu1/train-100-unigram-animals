## 📈 Overview
The **train-100-unigram-animals** project helps you understand how a simple language model works. It shows you, at a small scale, how a unigram language model is trained. This tool can be useful for students, educators, and anyone interested in the basics of machine learning and natural language processing.

## 🤔 What is a Unigram Language Model?
A unigram language model predicts the next word in a sentence based on the frequency of individual words. This model does not consider the order of words but focuses solely on their occurrence. This approach simplifies the complexities of language modeling, making it an excellent starting point for beginners.
